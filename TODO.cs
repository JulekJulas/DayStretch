the whole day is wonked, gotta fix that
-Add more settings
-As for vanilla needs they work but modded might use a different timer for whatever reason, remember that
-Fix the text in the mod config menu
-Make settings look better
-Our todays sponsor is Raid Shadow Legends
-Maybe fix the date completly breaking if you change the time multiplier mid-game though note: it may be impossible and if possible very hard
